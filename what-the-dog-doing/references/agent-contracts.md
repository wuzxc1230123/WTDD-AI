# Agent Contracts

Completion markers and handoff schemas for all WTDD agents. Workflows use these markers to detect agent completion and route accordingly.

This doc describes what IS, not what should be. Casing inconsistencies are documented as they appear in agent source files.

| wtdd-ui-checker | UI validation | `## ISSUES FOUND` |
| wtdd-ui-researcher | UI spec creation | `## UI-SPEC COMPLETE`, `## UI-SPEC BLOCKED` |
| wtdd-verifier | Post-execution verification | `## Verification Complete` (title case) |
| wtdd-integration-checker | Cross-phase integration check | `## Integration Check Complete` (title case) |
| wtdd-nyquist-auditor | Sampling audit | `## PARTIAL`, `## ESCALATE` (non-standard) |
| wtdd-security-auditor | Security audit | `## OPEN_THREATS`, `## ESCALATE` (non-standard) |
| wtdd-codebase-mapper | Codebase analysis | No marker (writes docs directly) |
| wtdd-assumptions-analyzer | Assumption extraction | No marker (returns `## Assumptions` sections) |
| wtdd-doc-verifier | Doc validation | No marker (writes JSON to `.planning/tmp/`) |
| wtdd-doc-writer | Doc generation | No marker (writes docs directly) |
| wtdd-advisor-researcher | Advisory research | No marker (utility agent) |
| wtdd-user-profiler | User profiling | No marker (returns JSON in analysis tags) |
| wtdd-intel-updater | Codebase intelligence analysis | `## INTEL UPDATE COMPLETE`, `## INTEL UPDATE FAILED` |

## Marker Rules

1. **ALL-CAPS markers** (e.g., `## PLANNING COMPLETE`) are the standard convention
2. **Title-case markers** (e.g., `## Verification Complete`) exist in wtdd-verifier and wtdd-integration-checker -- these are intentional as-is, not bugs
3. **Non-standard markers** (e.g., `## PARTIAL`, `## ESCALATE`) in audit agents indicate partial results requiring orchestrator judgment
4. **Agents without markers** either write artifacts directly to disk or return structured data (JSON/sections) that the caller parses
5. Markers must appear as H2 headings (`## `) at the start of a line in the agent's final output

## Key Handoff Contracts

### Planner -> Executor (via PLAN.md)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Frontmatter | Yes | phase, plan, type, wave, depends_on, files_modified, autonomous, requirements |
| `<objective>` | Yes | What the plan achieves |
| `<tasks>` | Yes | Ordered task list with type, files, action, verify, acceptance_criteria |
| `<verification>` | Yes | Overall verification steps |
| `<success_criteria>` | Yes | Measurable completion criteria |

### Executor -> Verifier (via SUMMARY.md)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Frontmatter | Yes | phase, plan, subsystem, tags, key-files, metrics |
| Commits table | Yes | Per-task commit hashes and descriptions |
| Deviations section | Yes | Auto-fixed issues or "None" |
| Self-Check | Yes | PASSED or FAILED with details |

## Workflow Regex Patterns

Workflows match these markers to detect agent completion:

**plan-phase.md matches:**
- `## RESEARCH COMPLETE` / `## RESEARCH BLOCKED` (researcher output)
- `## PLANNING COMPLETE` (planner output)
- `## CHECKPOINT REACHED` (planner/executor pause)
- `## VERIFICATION PASSED` / `## ISSUES FOUND` (plan-checker output)

**execute-phase.md matches:**
- `## PHASE COMPLETE` (all plans in phase done)
- `## Self-Check: FAILED` (summary self-check)

> **NOTE:** `## PLAN COMPLETE` is the wtdd-executor's completion marker but execute-phase.md does not regex-match it. Instead, it detects executor completion via spot-checks (SUMMARY.md existence, git commit state). This is intentional behavior, not a mismatch.
